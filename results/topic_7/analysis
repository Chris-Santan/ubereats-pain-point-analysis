Unauthorized or Incorrect Tip Charges

I went through all 70 one by one and assigned each review a single primary focus so the counts sum to 70.

1. Double, triple, or unauthorized tip/charge issues

Things like tip charged twice, order charged multiple times, tip taken after $0 + cash tip, PayPal double charges, surprise extra charges after the fact.

25 out of 70 reviews

About 36 percent

This is the largest bucket. Most of these call it “theft” or “scam”, and often mention having to dispute charges with the bank or being refused a refund by support.

2. Forced or manipulative tipping and high default tips

Tip added by default, cannot place order without a minimum tip, app choosing higher percentages (for example switching 15 percent to 18 percent), constant pressure to tip, or feeling forced to tip instead of using cash.

14 out of 70 reviews

About 20 percent

People complain that the app enforces tip levels, pushes large tips (for example 7 dollars on a 20 dollar order), or quietly changes the selected percentage after delivery.

3. Cannot edit, add, or remove tip (flow or policy)

User wants to change a tip (up or down), remove a mistaken tip, or add a tip for a driver later, but the app flow does not allow it or the option is missing.

14 out of 70 reviews

About 20 percent

This includes things like the one hour edit window not actually being usable, no way to lower a tip for poor service, or having to choose only preset percentages with no real control.

If you combine this with the UI bug category below, about 29 percent of reviews are basically "I cannot control my tip even when I want to".

4. Tip UI bugs or glitches

Custom tip field not working, keyboard not responding, screen disappearing when trying to tip, tip UI button doing nothing, scrolling bugs that prevent saving.

6 out of 70 reviews

About 9 percent

These are clearly technical failures that make it impossible or very difficult to set the intended tip amount.

5. Nontransparent totals, tip amounts, or calculators

Cannot see the full total with tip, percentage shown without dollar amount, tip calculator “wrong”, or confusing holds and totals.

5 out of 70 reviews

About 7 percent

These users complain they have to calculate the grand total outside the app, that the suggested tip amount misrepresents the percentage, or that it is “very sus” how fees and tips are displayed.

6. General high cost or fee complaints where tip is part of the pain

Overall cost is “criminal”, service fees plus tip feel excessive, discounts do not reduce the total, or the app makes orders far more expensive than the food value.

5 out of 70 reviews

About 7 percent

These reviews are more about the entire cost stack (service fee plus tip plus other fees) rather than a specific bug, but they still live under the tipping and cost structure umbrella.

7. Miscellaneous

Reviews that refer to tip issues indirectly or mostly talk about something else but appear in this cluster.
