Broken or Unreliable Promo Codes

1. Promo codes simply do not work when applied

87 of 155 reviews (≈56 percent)

People enter a code and get generic errors like “cannot be applied,” “invalid,” or “doesn’t work,” even when they say they meet all the terms.

Patterns here:

New-user codes that never work on “first order” despite it being the first order.

Email / postcard / in-app promos that cannot be claimed at checkout.

App shows a promo as available in the UI, but as soon as they try to apply it they get “oops,” “error,” or “promo can’t be applied.”

User impact: these people feel they were explicitly promised a discount that never becomes real at any point in the flow.

2. Promo codes revoked, removed, or expiring early

28 of 155 reviews (≈18 percent)

Here the code exists and may even show as applied, but is then taken away.

What they describe:

Code is active when they start the order, but is “deactivated” or “cancelled” while they are building or placing the order.

Promo shows as applied during selection and disappears at checkout, or after they modify the basket slightly.

Codes “disappear” from the account before the published end date, or just vanish from the promo list.

User framing: words like “bait and switch,” “scam,” and “false advertising” show up a lot in this bucket.

3. Promo marked as already used or used too many times

6 of 155 reviews (≈4 percent)

These users say they have never used the code (or even never used the app) but get errors like “already used,” “max redemptions reached,” or “redeemed too many times.”

This is especially damaging for:

Direct mail / postcard campaigns.

Referral codes from friends.

Because it makes the user feel the campaign itself is illegitimate.

4. Promo appears applied, but user is charged full price or overcharged

14 of 155 reviews (≈9 percent)

These are “financial discrepancy” cases rather than pure “code error” cases.

Reported patterns:

Promo looks accepted or is shown in the UI, but the final charge to the card is the full amount with no discount.

User expects a discounted total (for example 40 percent or $X off), but the receipt / bank statement shows no reduction or even higher-than-expected charge.

Some explicitly say they only realized after checking their bank that the promo had not been honored, despite the app appearing to accept it.

These reviews use very strong language (scam, theft), because money was actually taken in a way that feels deceptive.

5. Not enough promos / stopped receiving them / promo policy complaints

8 of 155 reviews (≈5 percent)

This group is less about technical failure and more about promotion strategy and fairness.

They mention:

“They stopped giving me promo codes after I complained about wrong orders.”

“There aren’t enough promo codes for returning customers; only new people get deals.”

“Still waiting for my Disney+ code / promised benefit never arrived.”

This is more about perceived favoritism and broken expectations from campaigns.

6. Eligibility and account restrictions tied to promos

5 of 155 reviews (≈3 percent)

These users can use the app generally but are blocked from promos due to vague or unexplained restrictions.

Examples:

“Your account is not eligible for new promotion codes” on a brand-new account.

Messages about “irregular activities” and permanent feature restrictions after they try to use a promo.

“Not in the right group” to receive a promotion, even though the promo banner is visible on their account.

To the user, this feels arbitrary and almost punitive.

7. Promo issue combined with very bad customer support

1 of 155 reviews (≈1 percent) as the primary focus

Many reviews mention support in passing, but only one is primarily about support itself rather than the code.

The pattern across many reviews (even outside this bucket) is still worth calling out qualitatively:

Long chat loops with multiple agents.

No clear resolution, agents saying they “can’t see” promos or “can’t help” because promos are only visible on the customer side.

No phone number or direct channel, just FAQ loops.

You could treat “support cannot repair promo problems” as a cross-cutting theme.

8. UX / process complaints around promo use

6 of 155 reviews (≈4 percent)

Here the code might work, but the user experience is painful or confusing.

Examples:

Too many steps to complete an order with a promo.

Can’t see where to enter the code at all.

New visual design for promo tags (hazard yellow) called out as confusing or unpleasant.

Needing to go to desktop to add codes because the app flow is broken.

These users are effectively saying “you are making me work too hard to redeem the discount you pushed on me.”

9. A small number of positive or neutral promo mentions

A tiny minority explicitly praise the number or generosity of promos (for example, “99 percent discount code… love you, one of the best apps that offer a lot of promo codes”). These are rare and do not offset the overwhelming negative trend on reliability.
